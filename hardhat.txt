1) Mention the differences between Hardhat and Truffle.
Ans- Difference  between  are
      Haedhat                               Trruffle          
1.Faster migration process                  1.Poor migration process
2.less gas fees while miration.             2.More gas fees while miration.
3. easy debugging.                          3. not good as Hardhat



2) Write a Smart Contract and demonstrate the steps
involved in the process of compilation using Hardhat
Development Environment.

Ans- requirements terminal (git bash)

   -In terminal check requirements 
    command*nmp -v*
    commmand *node -v*
    TO make a folder run command *mkdir projectname*
    TO change directory  *cd projectname*
    To install hardhat run command*npm install --save-dev hardhat*
    TO create a hardhat project run command *npx hardhat*
   select *Create a JavaScript project* hit enter 
    You need to install these dependencies to run the sample project:
    run command *npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.17.3" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^3.0.0" *
     
    TO open with code editor run command *code ..*
     
   In code editor select contract folder and create file in it. give name to file with .sol extension
    now writing our smart contract in Token.sol file
        
 // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
 pragma solidity ^0.8.7;
  contract Token {
    string public name = "CATO";
    string public symbol = "CAT";
    uint public TotalSupply = 1000;
     address public owner;

 mapping(address=>uint) balances;
 event transfer(address indexed from ,address indexed to,uint256 value);
constructor (){
    balances[msg.sender]= TotalSupply;
    owner= msg.sender;
}
 function Transfer (address to,uint256 amount) external{
     require (balances[msg.sender]>= amount);
     balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
     balances[to]+=amount;

     emit transfer (msg.sender,to,amount);
   
 }
   function Balanceof (address account) external view returns (uint256){
    return balances[account];
   }
  }
  

 Save all the changes  in code editor's
 go to the terminal 
 and run command to compile contract *npx hardhat compile*
  Compiled 2 Solidity files successfully
