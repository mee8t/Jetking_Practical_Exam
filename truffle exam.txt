Truffle Develop.
 ans - step 1 open terminal of gitbash 
            2 check npm-v
            3  check node -v 
            4  check truffle package insert command truffle version
           5  create new dicrectory for truffle project 
           6 insert command mkdir metacoin 
           7 to enter in the directory insert a command cd metacoin
            to check present directory insert command pwd
           8 now download the metacoin box insert command truffle unbox metacoin
           9  truffle have default built in persnoal blockchain thats is truffle trffle (develop)>
              that can use for testing 
            10 insert command truffle develop
             11 in truffle develop in command truffle migrate for intreacting blockchain 
   


 2) Explain the steps involved in interacting with the Smart contract
using Truffle develop.
ans- for interacting with smart contract we will use console 
      1insert a command truffle console
       this will leads us into truffle(development)>
        2  then insert a command let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed()
        3 insert command lest accounts = await web3.eth.accounts()
         3 insert commant for check balance of metacoin of the accounts that deploed the contract let balance =await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
       5 insert command balance.toNumber()
        insert command see ether in accounts let ether =await instance .getBalanceInEth(accounts[0])
         to convert into number insert command ether.toNumber()
         instance .sendCoin(accounts[1],100)
         6 check the balance of the accounts let recive =await instance.Balance(accounts[1])
          recive.toNumber()
         7 to check the balance of the account send the meta coin insert command let balanceof = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
            balanceof.toNumber ()
